READ ME:
To run this application:

1. Run "npm install"
2. "node server.js" in directory
3. I have provided a test mongodb user in config.json, but please keep the username and password confidential as I use this for other projects aswell
4. If you don't want to run it with the DB, you can comment and uncomment the marked lines in server.js.
5. I have a running version that exists on Heroku as proof that it works: https://immense-brushlands-50334.herokuapp.com/
6. I also have a github of the sourcecode: https://github.com/CallumRbrts/gamesysTHT
